I have chosen 3 questions from "General scripting / logic" section

This is a maven project and I used TestNG with Selenium.

Question 1:
I have created a method for Question1. Method is in this class: src -> main -> java -> questions -> Question1.
Method name is “reverseEntireString”

Question 3:

For Question3 I have created two methods, which are here: src -> main -> java -> questions -> Question3.
Two methods are
1.	doesFileExist
2.	readingFromFile

Question 2:
Whatever else we have in this project except Question1,3 everything is part of Question2.
src -> main -> java -> browser we have a Browser class which is used to initiate the Browser and driver.

I followed page object model so, src -> main -> java -> pages I have created a SamplePage class which represents the sample html in Question2. In this class I have created two methods according to two questions of Question2.

I have created a SamplePageTest class here: src -> test -> java -> pages. This is just to show the way I want to create the test methods.
